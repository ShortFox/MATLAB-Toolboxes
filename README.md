# MATLAB-Toolboxes
The repository includes various time-series analysis toolboxes for MATLAB. 

All of the methods have been employed across numerous published research papers over the years.

A description of each toolbox is provided as a pdf file. 
Each toolbox includes example data for testing.

The following toolboxes are current included:

Synchro Toolbox - discrete and continuous relative-phase analysis and cross-spectral coherence analysis

Cluster Phase Analysis - for multivariate relative phase analysis

RQA Toolbox - auto and cross-recurrence quantification analysis (continuous and categorical data)

Fractal Toolbox - a range of (mono) fractal times series methods, as well as artificial data generation.
